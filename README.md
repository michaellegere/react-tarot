# tarot-app

**This is a vanilla-JS app that presents users with 3 random tarot cards.
The cards can be drawn in either upright or reverse position.**

## Why this app?

This is an app that I have thought of making in many different forms, but
ultimately seemed to make most sense in this very basic form. I have several
plans for scaling up this project, but for now it will exist as is.

As a philosophy student, I've often thought tarot was a silly concept that
defied logical thinking, however I've come to learn that tarot is an
incredibly powerful tool for reflection. The cards don't have strict interpretations,
nor do they always convey the same meaning every time and way they're pulled.
This app is an homage to the fun that I've had pulling random tarot cards
and trying to make a coherent narrative of what's in front of me.

## What I would change

Earlier versions of this project had a separate Library file that attempted to
store each card as a JS object; I also tried several methods of storing the images.
Each of these options, however, posed their own complications that I chose to
return to later. I would like to, in the near future, come back to these organizational
concerns and optimize the structure.

As it is, the app loads very slowly. Even in the few weeks since
I 'finished' this app, I've learned quite a bit through HackerRank and Codecademy
about efficiency and how this app might be improved. I think one large improvement
would involved reworking the divs that show the cards, and using another method to
display them. As is, they are set as background images, which I thought was a clever
workaround but is ultimately quite restricting.

I would also like to return to the formatting of the page to make it a bit better on
mobile, with snap-to-scroll and horizontal sliding. These are functionalities I've
practiced, and am excited to put into a live project.

Lastly, I would like to fill out the site with more information and a few more
functionalities. I think it would be super cool to do a BeReal-style app that
has users pull 3 cards / day and compare their readings to their friends'. This would
be a very long term project, but I think it's within reach!

**Thanks for checking out this repo! I'm constantly looking for new opportunities to
learn and apply the skills I've fostered. Feel free to checkout my portfolio site at
